# Responsive Navbar with Tailwind CSS

This project demonstrates a responsive navigation bar using Tailwind CSS. The navbar adjusts its layout based on the screen size, providing a mobile-friendly toggle button for smaller screens.

## Project Overview

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the responsive navbar.
- **Tailwind CSS**: The project uses the Tailwind CSS framework to style the navbar.
- **JavaScript**: A small JavaScript snippet is included to handle the toggle functionality of the mobile menu.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To view and work with this project, you'll need a web browser that supports modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Running the Project

1. **Clone or download the repository**.
2. **Open `index.html` in your web browser** to view the responsive navbar in action.

### File Structure

```
/project-root
│
└── index.html    # Main HTML file with responsive navbar
```

## HTML Structure

The HTML file consists of a simple structure:

- **`<nav>`**: The main navigation element, styled with Tailwind CSS classes.
- **`<div>`**: Containers for the logo and the menu button.
- **`<ul>`**: A list of navigation links. The visibility of this list is toggled on smaller screens using JavaScript.

## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is used for styling the navbar. It provides utility-first classes that help create responsive designs easily. Here's a breakdown of some key classes used:

- **`bg-gray-800`**: Sets the background color to a dark gray.
- **`text-white`, `text-gray-300`**: Sets the text colors.
- **`p-4`, `px-4`, `py-2`**: Adds padding.
- **`md:hidden`, `md:flex`**: Controls the visibility of elements based on the screen size (mobile-first design).
- **`hover:text-white`**: Changes the text color on hover.

## JavaScript

A small JavaScript snippet is included to handle the menu toggle functionality on smaller screens. It works by adding or removing the `hidden` class from the `<ul>` element when the menu button is clicked.

### Example JavaScript Code:

```javascript
const menuButton = document.getElementById('menu-button');
const menu = document.getElementById('menu');

menuButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    menu.classList.toggle('hidden');
});
```

## Customization

You can easily customize this navbar by:

- **Changing the colors**: Modify the Tailwind CSS classes to use different colors or add your own custom styles.
- **Adding more links**: Add additional `<li>` elements to the `<ul>` list to include more navigation options.
- **Updating the logo**: Replace the "Logo" text with an actual image or SVG logo.
